BirthdayCraft is a _mod_ for Minecraft Java designed to help you organise your
birthday party inside of Minecraft!

This _mod_ was originally designed by
[_Ale & Lupo_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJlal2M8WXdRaVkAlGtHUOQ) for
Alejandro's 8th birthday ;-)

## Installation

### Install Minecraft Java Edition

This _mod_ is designed for [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/es-es/store/minecraft-java-edition/), which can be installed on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
If you don't alreafy have it, you can buy it [here](https://www.minecraft.net/es-es/store/minecraft-java-edition/)
(26,95 US$). After buying, and downloading, you should end up with
_Minecraft Launcher_ installed.

### Install Minecraft Forge

Once you have the _Minecraft Launcher_ installed on your computer (from previuos
step), you will also need to
[download and install Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).
This will allow you to install and run other _mods_, like BirthdayCraft.

The current version of BirthdayCraft is `1.15.2-1.0.0`, which basically means
that it is meant to be run with Minecraft Forge `1.15.2` (ideally
`1.15.2-31.2.0`, which is currently the _recommended_ download on the
[official Forge page](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)). Make sure you
download the _installer_ package.

After downloading you should have a file called something like
`forge-1.15.2-31.2.0-installer.jar`. Double click on the file to _run_ it. If
that doesn't work, please try making the file executable by adding the relevant
permissions (this will depend on your system). When the forge installer is run
you should see something like this:

Choose the option to _Install client_ in the default location and click OK and
wait for the installation to finish.

### Create Forge installation within Minecraft Launcher if necessary

Now open your

If the Forge installer did not already add a _forge_ installation in your
Minecraft Launcher, you can always create a new one using the launcher's
interface.
